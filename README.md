# AwakeLabs Challenge

## How to run

1. Create a virtualenv
2. `pip install jupyterlab` or use another method of installation here: https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab'
3. Add the `data.json` file to the directory you're working in
4. Run `jupyter lab` which will open up the Jupyter Lab on localhost
5. Run the code blocks in order from top to bottom
6. Adjust the date and graph style in the makeGraph function call to create a graph at that specified date and whether you want the day's BPM to be shown or the week corresponding to it. Setting `is_day=True` will show the graph for that day, and `is_day=True` for the week.
